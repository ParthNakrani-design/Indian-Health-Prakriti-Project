## 📖 Description

Indian Health is a web-based wellness application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It helps users understand their Ayurvedic body constitution (Prakriti) — identifying the balance between Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas through an interactive questionnaire.

After analyzing the user's responses, the system:
- Calculates their Prakriti type and percentage** of each dosha.
- Provides a personalized diet plan and daily routine.
- Tracks daily mood, energy, and progress for holistic wellness.

This project promotes awareness of traditional Indian health concepts through a modern digital experience.
